					<p class="blog">
						We at ECSC would like to congratulate our very own Alan Jennings for competing in the 2018 World Surf League in California this summer. 
						The World Surf League is one of the most favored competitions in the North American surfing circuit for its good stoke, great conditions and barreling competition.  This year’s Competition – as ever – did not disappoint, especially as one of our very own club members took home with him a silver medal from Cali this June.<br>
						Alan Jennings, in the wake of his massive victory and accomplishment in the States, has decided to take a short break from competitive surfing as he focuses on his final year studying Biomedics at UCD. We wish him the best of luck in all his endevors.
