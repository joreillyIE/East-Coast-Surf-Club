			<h2 class="about_us">Who are we? A Dublin-based surf club.</h2>
			<p class="about_us">ECSC was started in 1965 by Kevin Cavey and originally called the Bray Surf Club. We are a group of Leinster based surfers travelling regularly for waves and craic. Most weekends our members head West and sometimes we arrange trips abroad. We have an online forum where members organise their own trips, arrange lifts, talk about equipment etc, and new members are very welcome. We welcome surfers from beginners to advanced.<br><br>
			The East Coast Surf Club is situated around Dublin although we have members from all over the country. The Irish Sea is not known for its waves but given the right conditions it can produce some great swell! Ireland gets all the weather the Atlantic can throw at us which is a blessing for surfers though conditions can change fast. The coastline is dotted with inlets and coves so no matter what the weather you can be guaranteed some form of wave.We donâ€™t disclose the locations of breaks online so if you are interested why not come along to one our socials.
